# @#x2653; HexaPawn &#x2654;

This is a project I worked on in CS 448, Machine learning, in university. Hexapawn is a game played on a 3x3 board. The premise of the game
is to play something simple enough a beginner could train the computer quickly to achieve domination against a human opponent. At its
current state, if a bot is able to remember roughly 11-13 boards it will have an incredibly high likelyhood of winning all following games.
