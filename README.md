# &#x2659; HexaPawn &#x2658;

This is a project I worked on in CS 448, Machine learning, at university. Hexapawn is a game played on a 3x3 or greater board, where the objective is to get your pawn to the far square. The pieces are similar to pawn in chess, where they can take a piece diagonally and advance forward.

Hexapawn was chosen as it is to play something simple enough a beginner could train the computer quickly to achieve domination against a human opponent. At its current state, if a bot is able to remember roughly 11-13 boards it will have an incredibly high likelyhood of winning all following games.
